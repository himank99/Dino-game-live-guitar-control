# Dino-game-live-guitar-control
Dino game(implemented using pygame module) which is controlled by guitar chords and the model is trained using tensorflow and keras.

# Requirements
- PyGame
- Tensorflow
- PyAudio
- Keras


## Reference Paper for Guitar chords
[Research paper](http://www.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/services/acous/STSI/file/jim2012Chords.zip) NEURAL NETWORKS FOR MUSICAL CHORDS RECOGNITION.
To convert WAV file to data(HPCP)[Here](https://github.com/jvbalen/hpcp_demo) Harmonic Pitch Class Profile extraction

## TODO list
- [ ] Add an option menu to choose which chord will control jump and duck.
- [ ] Decrese the delay of action by reducing the model size and re-train.
